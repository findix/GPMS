### This can be used to set your default locale and encoding scheme

### when set to true, Struts will act much more friendly for developers. This
### includes:
### - struts.i18n.reload = true
### - struts.configuration.xml.reload = true
### - raising various debug or ignorable problems to errors
###   For example: normally a request to foo.action?someUnknownField=true should
###                be ignored (given that any value can come from the web and it
###                should not be trusted). However, during development, it may be
###                useful to know when these errors are happening and be told of
###                them right away.
struts.devMode =true 

### when set to true, resource bundles will be reloaded on _every_ request.
### this is good during development, but should never be used in production
struts.i18n.reload=true
